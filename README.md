ML Workshop: Part 1: Spotify API, Spotipy, EDA

Codecademy meetup https://community.codecademy.com/events/details/codecademy-seoul-presents-ml-workshop-analysing-k-pop-with-python-spotify-part-1-spotify-api-spotipy-eda/

Meetup description: 
üêç How can we obtain audio feature data? 
üêç What can song metadata tell us about a track? 
üêç What makes a K-pop track popular? 
In part one of this machine learning workshop, we will focus on obtaining data on K-pop through Spotify's API, using Python library Spotipy, plus cleaning and exploring the resulting data. This is a collab with Meghana (Codecademy Hyderabad). 

We will be covering the following topics: 

Spotify Web API
Spotipy
Extracting data
EDA & data visualisation 
Stay tuned for part 2, coming up in August, when we will work with the data and move into the machine learning side of things. ‚úåÔ∏è
